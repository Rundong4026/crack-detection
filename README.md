# crack-detection
This is the crack data set used in the article "Automated Bridge Crack Detection Using Convolutional Neural Networks". The bridge crack data set in [1] is artificially enhanced to generate the data set used in our paper.

If you want to use this data set, we recommend that you quote our paper.
